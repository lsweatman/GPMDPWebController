Build with `npm install` then `npm run build-p` or `npm run build-dev`. 

From there you can start a server with `npm run start-server`, open an electron window with `npm run start-electron`, or just open /src/static/index.html.

If you want a version that is built into the unofficial desktop player look [here](https://github.com/lsweatman/Google-Play-Music-Desktop-Player-UNOFFICIAL-).

IP is configurable if opened in a browser, but defaults to localhost for Electron.
